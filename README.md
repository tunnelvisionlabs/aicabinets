# AI Cabinets

This repository contains Ruby scripts for SketchUp that generate simple cabinetry models from code.

## Contents

- `lib/cabinet.rb` – library functions for creating cabinets.
- `examples/frameless_two_shelf_cabinet.rb` – sample script that creates a frameless cabinet with two shelves.

Copy the library and sample code into SketchUp's Ruby console or load them as scripts to build cabinet geometry automatically.
