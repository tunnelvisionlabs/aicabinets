# Prototype reference (read-only)

- `lib/` contains prototype/POC reference implementations retained for historical context during the SketchUp extension MVP.
- Agents must not edit files in this directory unless working on a maintainer-approved migration or removal task.
- The directory will be removed once the extension reaches a superset of the prototype's feature parity.
